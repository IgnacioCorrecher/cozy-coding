Welcome to my **Cozy Coding** repository — a collection of small, silent-coding projects designed for peaceful learning, relaxing vibes, and simple creativity.  
Each folder contains a complete project that can be coded in **30 minutes or less**, using **minimal dependencies**, and following a calm, aesthetic workflow.

This repo grows alongside the YouTube channel, where each project appears as a **no-talking, keyboard-ASMR coding session**.
